					<h2>About Me</h2><hr>
						<img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" id=me src="assets/images/profile.jpg">
						Even though I haven't necessarily taken the conventional path through education (I dropped out of high school when I was 16), I have always greatly valued knowledge and education.  After working for a few years, I realized how much I missed being a student, got my GED, took my SAT and proceeded to get a B.S. and M.S. in mathematics.  Since I completed my graduate degree about 6 years ago, I have been teaching mathematics at the college level.  I've taught courses ranging from pre-algebra all the way up through business math, statistics, the entire calculus sequence, differential equations and linear algebra.  While I love teaching and its a very rewarding job, its hasn't been personally challenging in the way I want it to be.  I love music (my first passion in life), snowboarding, backpacking (mostly in the mountains) and just about anything having to do with the outdoors.  Most of all though, I love solving problems.  I love to learn and I love a challenge.  Before I finished my degree, I was (among other things) a musician, a journeyman ironworker and a commercial salmon fisherman in Alaska.  I think coding is one of the few fields that practically guarantees that I can be a student as long as I want to be and will continue to challenge me for the rest of my life.
