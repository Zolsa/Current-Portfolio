					<h2>About Me</h2><hr>
						<img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" id=me src="assets/images/profile.jpg">
						Even though I haven't necessarily taken the conventional path through education (I dropped out of high school when I was 16), I have always greatly valued knowledge and education.  After working for a few years, I realized how much I missed being a student, got my GED, took my SAT and proceeded to get a B.S. and M.S. in mathematics.  Since I completed my graduate degree about 6 years ago, I have been teaching mathematics at the college level.  I've taught courses ranging from pre-algebra all the way up through business math, statistics, the entire calculus sequence, differential equations and linear algebra.  While I love teaching and its a very rewarding job, its hasn't been personally challenging in the way I want it to be.  I love music (my first passion in life), snowboarding, backpacking (mostly in the mountains) and just about anything having to do with the outdoors.  Most of all though, I love solving problems.  I love to learn and I love a challenge.  Before I finished my degree, I was (among other things) a musician, a journeyman ironworker and a commercial salmon fisherman in Alaska.  I think coding is one of the few fields that practically guarantees that I can be a student as long as I want to be and will continue to challenge me for the rest of my life (and my children's lives and their children's lives... if we don't destroy the planet before then).
